Exercise 03: Javascript Basics part 1
Title: Simulate a password validation program in JavaScript

For this exercise, we are to create three different functions,
wherein we used two first two functions to implement a function 
that stores password and name of user

For the first function, we are to validate if the 2 passwords match,
where the criteria of the password must be:
- they must match each other
- at least 8 characters, and
- contains at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 number character

Here, I formed two separate functions, where I used if-else and for loop statements. The two functions are:
1 -- for character validation (if they met the last 2 criteria), and
2 -- for password validation (i.e., for mathcing)
NOTE: I created two separated functions to validate for Password 1 and Password 2

Moving forward, I only used a for loop statement for the reverse function.

Lastly, using the first two functions I created, I was able to create a function that output the name and newpassword for user.
It was able to use the validatePassword Function to check if the passwords are similar or not, and the Reverse Function to create
a new password for the user if his/her passwords are not valid.
